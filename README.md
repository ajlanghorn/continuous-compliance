# Continuous Compliance

A large number of customers have compliance requirements - either because they're required to by their own internal processes and teams, or because they're regulated by external bodies and laws. Moving to the cloud, in a compliant way, can be time-consuming, and ensuring compliance over a long period, whilst letting developers build without hindrance, can be complicated and difficult.

It doesn't have to be this way!

Using AWS services such as AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon GuardDuty and others, it's possible to create a centralised view of compliance across multiple accounts, deployed in an automatable fashion, and visible as a one-stop compliance dashboard for stakeholders across your organisation.

## Framework

The [Center for Internet Security](https://cisecurity.org) produce benchmarks for a variety of products and services in order to help users configure these services in a secure fashion. One common benchmark used by our customers is the CIS Amazon Web Services Fundamentals, available from [the AWS website](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf).

We'll use this framework, as it provides prescriptive guidance, for the rest of this workshop.

## Getting started

Before we begin to build, you'll need:

- an AWS account
- IAM credentials exported to your shell, as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

To test you have things set up correctly, you can run `aws sts get-caller-identity`. The response to this command should contain your account number and the name of your IAM user.
